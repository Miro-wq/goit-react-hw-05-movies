## Project Overview

This is a homework task project for a movie search and storage application built with React.js, leveraging the themoviedb.org API for fetching movie data. It showcases popular movies, allows users to search for specific titles, and provides detailed information about each movie, including cast and reviews. The application also implements React features like routing, code splitting, and lazy loading to ensure a smooth user experience. This project is designed to deepen my knowledge of React, API integration, and modern web development practices.

## Movie Search  

Create a basic routing system for a movie search and storage application. You can view a preview of the application here.

### API: themoviedb.org

For the backend, use the [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API. You need to register and obtain an API key. In this task, you will use the following endpoints:

- `/trending/get-trending` - the list of todayâ€™s most popular movies to create a collection on the homepage.
- `/search/search-movies` - search for a movie by keywords on the movie search page.
- `/movies/get-movie-details` - request detailed information about a movie for the movie details page.
- `/movies/get-movie-credits` - request cast information for the movie details page.
- `/movies/get-movie-reviews` - request reviews for the movie details page.

## Routes

The application should have the following routes. If the user accesses a non-existent route, they should be redirected to the homepage.

- `'/'` - Home component, the homepage with the list of popular movies.
- `'/movies'` - Movies component, the search page for movies by keyword.
- `'/movies/:movieId'` - MovieDetails component, the detailed movie information page.
- `'/movies/:movieId/cast'` - Cast component, cast information displayed on the MovieDetails page.
- `'/movies/:movieId/reviews'` - Reviews component, reviews displayed on the MovieDetails page.

## Code Splitting

Add asynchronous JS code loading for the application routes using `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>`.
